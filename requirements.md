2. [Where to write your code](https://gist.github.com/on1234/0ba02b7c88dc38eba25c9c28f38781d6#where-to-write-your-code)
3. [Resources](https://gist.github.com/on1234/0ba02b7c88dc38eba25c9c28f38781d6#resources)

**The code must be written in JavaScript, preferably using Vue (2 or 3) or React.**


## Details of the case

The objective is to create a sample web app with two pages looking like the image below:

![demo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37439094/246389900-3a8f1a6f-5700-44c3-9340-f320be7b16de.gif)

### The start (Home) page
This is the start page and contains a report with data fetched from an API. Please see the Resources below for details of the API.

### The Customer page
The customer page loads a list of customers from an API. Please see the Resources below for details of the API.

### Other details
Feel free to add your own improvements or customizations to the project. Here's a few ideas if there's some extra time:

* Show placeholder/loading indicator when loading the data from the APIs

* Make it possible to "log out" by clicking on the User-information, show a dropdown with a "Log out"-button. After clicking log out, a blank page with some nice "You've been logged out" can be displayed.

* Make the customer list searchable. The API supports the querystring `name`

## Where to write your code

Use an online code editor to such as codesandbox.io to write your code. It's a fast and easy way to write code in your browser and includes a live preview.

The code must be written in JavaScript, preferably using Vue (2 or 3) or React.

### Launch a project on codesandbox

1. Simply go to https://codesandbox.io/ and click "Create" or "Try for free". It's probably a good idea to sign in  so you don't risk losing your work if you close your browser.

2. Select a template: Use one of: Vue 2, Vue 3, or React.

3. Your editor is launched and you can start coding!

4. When done, send the url e.g., "https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/your-sand-box-url" to us, make sure the project is visible when not logged in to you Codesandbox.
